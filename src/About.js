              <p>
                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean
                restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
                The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and
                have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has
                a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular
                place for a meal any time of the day.
              </p>

                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved
                to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
                To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a
                chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the
                effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
